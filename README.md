# Use Case (Pilot): AI-Enhanced Invoice Automation System

Background - Client fee billing and invoicing are essential components of investment banking operations. Fees are typically derived from the valuation of investment accounts 
and calculated over defined periods such as monthly, quarterly, or annually. Based on this fee information, invoices are then generated and issued to clients for the relevant accounts.

## 1. Executive Summary
This pilot project proposes integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the existing invoice generation and approval workflow for investment accounts. 
The AI enhancements aim to reduce manual workload, improve invoice accuracy, accelerate approvals, and deliver a better client experience through smart insights and automation.

## 2. Problem Statement
Despite current automation, key pain points remain:

- Manual effort in identifying fee anomalies.
- Manual effort in identifying valuation anomalies.
- Delays in invoice approvals and exception handling.  
- No prioritization or predictive intelligence in the review process.

## 3. Objectives

- **Improve Accuracy**: Use machine learning to flag outliers and anomalous fees.  
- **Faster Approvals**: Use predictive models to recommend likely invoice outcomes.  
- **Reduce Exception Workload**: Deploy an AI assistant to assist in triaging and resolving flagged invoices. 

## 4. Scope

- **Duration**: 3–6 weeks  
- **Accounts Covered**: 10–15 representative investment accounts  
- **AI Enhancements**:
  - Anomaly Detection Engine (ML)
  - Natural Language Invoice Summary Generator (LLM/NLP)
  - Approval Outcome Predictor (Classification Model)

## 5. Expected Outcomes

| Metric                         | Current Baseline     | Pilot Goal                        |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Fee anomaly detection         | Manual only           | ≥ 80% automated detection accuracy |
| Invoice approval time         | 3–5 days              | < 1 day average                    |
| Exception resolution time     | Several days          | 50% faster                         |
| Client queries about invoices | Frequent              | ≥ 30% reduction                    |

## 6. Resources Required

- **Data Scientist** – Develop ML/NLP models  
- **Developer** – Integrate AI modules into current systems  
- **Business Analyst** – Track KPIs and pilot metrics  
- **Stakeholder Sponsor** – Oversight, prioritization, and reporting  

## 7. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                        | Mitigation                                      |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Inaccurate AI predictions  | Human-in-the-loop validation initially          |
| Data sensitivity           | Use anonymized or synthetic data for training   |
| Low adoption or skepticism | Provide explainability, confidence scores, and involve users early |

## 8. Success Criteria

- ≥ 80% accuracy in flagged fee anomalies  
- ≥ 50% faster invoice approval and exception resolution  
- Positive feedback from at least 2 client-facing teams and 2 clients  
- Strong case for expanding to full implementation  

## 9. Timeline

- **Week 1**: Scope approval, resource alignment  
- **Week 3–4**: Develop AI prototypes  
- **Week 5**: Integrate & test with selected accounts  
- **Week 6**: Review results, assess KPIs, recommend next steps
